# Election-Data

The goal of this project is to create your own client code that imports the FilerReader and a Parser that you make to answer the questions below.  If the question could return more than one piece of data in the answer, declare, store, and return your answer as an array.

-  find states with at least/at most/ and exactly blank counties.  It is best to think of this as 3 separate functions which all perform basically.
-  find all state totals and store them in a new array (aka this happens when the  fips == 0)
-  find all states where percent difference was less than p%
-  sort counties within a given state from least to greatest total votes
-  name counties a candidate won in a state and show percent.
-  which state had the county with the largest % difference
-  which state had the county with the largest literal vote difference

## Files to make

Again, you will need to create and upload your electionParser file and a separate client file which complete the questions above.
